Everybody knows that all applications in the world needs a counter. Thats why I built a counter in Elm,
just in case...

Or actually I just built this to learn something new 🕺

## dev

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weslleyaraujo/elm-counter.git
cd elm-counter
yarn
yarn start
```

Elm is a lot of fun so far ✌️
